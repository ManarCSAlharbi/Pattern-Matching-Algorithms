## 🗂 Project Description
This project explores and compares two popular pattern matching algorithms: **Brute Force** and **Horspool**. Developed as part of the **CPCS324 - Algorithms and Data Structures I** course at King Abdulaziz University, this program:
- Reads text from a file 📄
- Generates random patterns 🎲
- Compares the performance of both algorithms 📊

---

## ✨ Features
- 📚 Reads text data from `input.txt`.
- 🧙 Generates random patterns of user-defined length.
- ⚡ Implements and compares:
  - 🔧 **Brute Force Algorithm**
  - 🚀 **Horspool Algorithm**
- 🕒 Calculates and displays average search times for each algorithm.
- 📂 Outputs generated patterns and analysis results to files.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** 📄:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/projectname.git
   cd projectname
   ```

2. **Prepare the input file** 🗒:
   - Place your text file named `input.txt` in the project directory.

3. **Compile the program** 🔨:
   ```bash
   javac CPCS2024_Group10_pt1.java
   ```

4. **Run the program** ▶️:
   ```bash
   java cpcs2024_group10_pt1
   ```

5. **Follow the prompts**:
   - 💾 Enter the number of lines to read from the file.
   - 🗐 Specify the length of each pattern.
   - 🎲 Define the number of patterns to generate.

---

## 📤 Outputs
- **patterns.txt**: Contains all the generated patterns.
- **Console Output**:
  - Detailed results of the pattern matching.
  - 📊 Average search times for both algorithms.
